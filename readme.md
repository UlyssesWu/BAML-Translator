#BAML Translator
---
A tool for WPF program localization.

BAML Translator uses [**dnlib**](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnlib) (by 0xd4d) and [**ConfuserEx**](https://github.com/yck1509/ConfuserEx) (by yck1509)

##Notice

In BAML, simple strings and binding strings can not be divided.

You should identify them by yourself and **never change binding strings**.

It will be easier if the program is not in English. If it is, pay attention to spaces.

It may also be used to translate hard-coding strings.
