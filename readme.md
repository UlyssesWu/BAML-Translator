# UniTranslator

UniTranslator是用于本地化（汉化）WPF程序的工具（工具自身具备中/英文界面）。

A tool for WPF program localization.

It can translate strings in BAML, Hard-code and Resource.

**UniTranslator** (WPF) is the successor of **BAML Translator** (WinForm).

UniTranslator / BAML Translator uses [**dnlib**](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnlib) (by 0xd4d) and [**ConfuserEx**](https://github.com/yck1509/ConfuserEx) (by yck1509)

## Notice

In BAML, simple strings and binding strings can not be divided.

You should identify them by yourself and **never change binding strings**.

It will be easier if the program is not in English. If it is, pay attention to spaces.

It may also be used to translate hard-coding strings.

## Warning

Before using it, you should make sure there would not be a copyright issue.

I won't take any responsibility for any user's abuse of this tool.
